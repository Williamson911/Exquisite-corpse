#### This world is just too small

A long ago there was a boy who lived on a small island. His dream was to discover the worlds beyond. 
One day, he decided that it was time for him to go so he built a little boat and took the sea.
One night, as he was far from his home in the middle of these endless waters, a storm has broken out.
