#### This world is just too small

A long ago there was a boy who lived on a small island. His dream was to discover the worlds beyond. 
One day, he decided that it was time for him to go so he built a little boat and took to the sea.
One night, as he was far from his home in the middle of these endless waters, a storm has broken out.
</br>
He thinks "this looks a little too much like my favourite game 'Kingdom Hearts' I hope I don't end up like Sora and Riku".
</br>
The most logical thing that comes up to his mind is to come back home and try sailing another day.
</br>
So he gets back home, eat a good meal and goes to bed.

In his dreams, he imagines himself to be the king of pirates, admired by his own and feared by others. 

When he woke up, he was very sad to realize that nothing was true.

He was just a little boy.

C'est à ce moment là que le vaisseau Interprise fit son apparission et emporta Gus dans un univers parallèle afin d'essayer de le sauver si cela est encore possible...
