#### This world is just too small

A long ago there was a boy who lived on a small island. His dream was to discover the worlds beyond. 
One day, he decided that it was time for him to go so he built a little boat and took to the sea.
One night, as he was far from his home in the middle of these endless waters, a storm has broken out.
</br>
He thinks "this looks a little too much like my favourite game 'Kingdom Hearts' I hope I don't end up like Sora and Riku".
</br>
The most logical thing that comes up to his mind is to come back home and try sailing another day.
</br>
So he gets back home, eat a good meal and goes to bed.
